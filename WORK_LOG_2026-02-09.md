# Work Log - 2026-02-09 (MVP Setup)

## ✅ Completed Tasks
1.  **Repository Setup:**
    - Cloned `buranovt2025-jpg/gogomarke.uz`.
    - Created `main` branch.
    - Added `.gitignore` improvements.
2.  **Backend Deployment (Manual):**
    - Created `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for Node.js backend.
    - Configured server (`64.226.94.133`) with Docker & Docker Compose.
    - Set up `.env` on server with secure DB credentials (DigitalOcean Managed Postgres).
    - Connected Firebase Service Account (`firebase-service-account.json`) via Volume mapping.
    - **Result:** API is running at `http://64.226.94.133:3000`.
3.  **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):**
    - Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for auto-deploy.
    - Generated SSH keys (`github_actions`) and added public key to server.
    - **Status:** Secrets added to GitHub, but workflow failed on SSH handshake (fixed locally, needs verification).
    - **Fix:** Manually deployed backend to ensure uptime.

## ⚠️ Issues Encountered
- **GitHub Push Protection:** Blocked push due to exposed DB password in `.env.example`. Fixed by removing secret.
- **Port Conflict:** Port 3000 was occupied by an old process on server. Fixed by killing process (`fuser -k 3000/tcp`).
- **Flutter Build:** GitHub Action failed due to missing/outdated `android/build.gradle` files (compileSdk < 35).

## 📅 Next Steps (Tomorrow)
1.  **Frontend (Flutter):**
    - Fix `android/build.gradle` configuration (target SDK 35).
    - Verify `flutter build apk` succeeds.
2.  **Cloud Storage:**
    - Configure AWS SDK/Multer for DigitalOcean Spaces (S3) for video uploads.
3.  **Google Maps:**
    - Add Google Maps API key to Flutter (if needed for location).

## 🔄 Rollback Point
- Tag: `v0.1.0-mvp-backend` (Commit: `3e8034a`) - Working backend deployment.
